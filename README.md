This bot was built to be used on the [Discord](https://discord.com/) social platform. Its purpose is to retrieve a random quote from the [WikiQuote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/) site based on user queries. The results are to be returned to the user as in the form of a message, which is sent to the same channel as the user's query. This small project is not affiliated with WikiQuote.

## Running It Yourself
Setting up your own version of this bot will be a little more complicated than using my instance. This will involve utilizing Discord's [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) to register an application for the bot. I found this [guide](https://beebom.com/how-make-discord-bot/) to be particularly helpful for this process. Please note that you will have to use your own, unique token as necessary since you will be hosting a different instance of this bot from mine.

Once access is gained to the bot (through one method or another), you can read through the [commands](#how-to-use-this-bot) below to understand how to use it.
